Movie Watchlist Web API - Promineo Tech Final Project 

The Movie Watchlist Web API is my submission for the final project for the Promineo Tech Back End Software Development Course. This Rest API is a movie watchlist database
that is composed of users, watchlists, and movies. The users are able to create accounts and perform full CRUD operations on watchlists. Watchists are also able to add,
get, remove, and update the status of movies on their watchlist. All movies in the database can be retrieved or the user can retrieved movies in the database by genre. 

Future goals are to add actor and director entities, so movies will include this information and that movies can be searched by an actor or director.
